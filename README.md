# Idle Time Tracking

## Overview
This project tracks idle time of individuals in a given area using object detection and tracking. The system uses YOLOv8 for person detection and tracks movement to determine idle periods.

## Features
- Detects individuals in a given space
- Tracks movement to determine idle status
- Allows users to define regions of interest (ROIs) for tracking
- Outputs alerts or logs when idle time exceeds a threshold
- Supports RTMP streaming for real-time monitoring

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed, then install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Step 1: Define ROIs
Run the `box.py` script to create a JSON file containing regions of interest (ROIs) on a frame of the stream:
```bash
python box.py
```
This will generate a JSON file that is used for defining tracking areas.

### Step 2: Start Tracking
Run the main script to start idle time tracking:
```bash
python rtmp6.py
```
This will process the stream and monitor idle time within the defined ROIs.

## Configuration
- The JSON file generated by `box.py` must be in the same directory as `rtmp6.py`.
- Modify `rtmp6.py` to adjust thresholds for detecting idle behavior.

## Dependencies
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8
- NumPy
- PySimpleGUI (if GUI elements are used in `box.py`)
- RTMP support for streaming
